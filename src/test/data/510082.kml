			<description><![CDATA["The Univeristy of Oxford comprises <b>39 Colleges</b> and <b>7 Permanent Private Halls (PPHs)</b>, which are autonomous self-governming corporations within the university.  These colleges are not only houses of residence, but have substantial responsibility for the teaching of undergraduates.  Generally tutorials (the main method of teaching in Oxford) and classes are the responsibility of colleges, while lectures, examinations, laboratories and the central library are run by the univeristy.<br><br>
A typical college consists of a great hall for dining, a  chapel, a library, a college bar, senior, middle (postgraduate) and junior common rooms, room for 200-400 undergraduates as well as lodgings for the head of the college and other dons.  College buildings range from the mediaeval to very modern buildings, but most are made up of interlinked quadrangles (courtyards), with one or more large wooden gates controlling entry from the ourside."<br>

<br>
"The early history of the ancient University of Oxford is shrouded in uncertainty.<br>
<br>
It came into existence about eight hundred years ago, but in its early days it lacked organisation and facilities. Students had to fend for themselves in small groups based on inns and lodging houses.<br>
<br>
It was from these small groups that the modern University, consisting of an association of autonomous Colleges, evolved."<br>

Placemarked here are the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford that have evolved from those inns and lodging houses.  Each college selects its own students, presents them for matriculation in the University, is responsible for their academic studies, and, eventually, presents them for their degrees from Oxford University.]]></description>

"The College was founded in 1509 by a lawyer, Sir Richard Sutton, and the Bishop of Lincoln, William Smyth.  Smyth provided the money for the college's foundation, and Sutton acquired the property. It was built on the site of Brasenose Hall — one of the medieval Oxford institutions which originally existed just as a lodging house, but which had grown to become a seat of learning. The college still maintains traditional ties to its official Visitor, the Bishop of Lincoln.<br>
<br>
The name 'Brasenose' is thought to originate from a brazen (bronze) door knocker in the shape of a nose.  The nose-shaped door knocker which hangs above the high table of the main hall of Brasenose College is thought to be the original door knocker belonging to Brasenose Hall."   <br>

"Christ Church is one of the largest and wealthiest of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford. It is the only college in England which is also a cathedral (one of the smallest in England), the seat (cathedra) of the Bishop of Oxford. The Governing Body of Christ Church consists of the Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral, together with about sixty 'Students', who until the 19th century had no governing powers, but are now equivalent to Fellows in other colleges. Traditionally it has been seen as the most aristocratic college. It has produced thirteen British prime ministers."<br>

"St. Frideswide's nunnery was destroyed by the Danes in 1002. The monastery was re-established for Austin Canons in 1122. The church was rebuilt in 1180 and St. Frideswide's body translated to a beautiful shrine. Many pilgrims visited her there, including Henry III, Edward I and Henry VIII's queen, Catherine of Aragon.<br><br> In 1525 Cardinal Wolsey gained permission from Pope Clement VII to dissolve the monastery and transform it into Cardinal College, with the Abbey Church as the college chapel. 

When Wolsey fell from power in 1529, the College became property of King Henry VIII.  

In 1546 Henry VIII changed this to Christ Church College and the church became the Cathedral of the new Diocese of Oxford."  <br>

						<description><![CDATA["Christ Church Meadow is a famous water-meadow, and popular walking and picnic spot in Oxford, England.<br><br>

Approximately triangular in shape it is bounded by the River Thames (the stretch through Oxford being known as the Isis), the River Cherwell, and Christ Church. It provides access to many of the college boat houses which are on an island at the confluence of the two rivers. The lower sections of the meadow, close to the Thames, are grazed by cattle, while the upper sections have sports fields.<br><br>

Christ Church Meadow is owned by Christ Church, and is therefore private property, but access is permitted during the day. Access starts very early to allow rowers access to the boathouses."<br>

"The college was founded in 1517 by Richard Fox, the Bishop of Winchester. Although intended as a traditional training college for secular clergy, under the influence of Hugh Oldham it became the foremost humanist enterprise in Oxford, the model for many subsequent foundations. Fox was a humanist and interested in classical literature. He founded a library which was very progressive for the time. The library included books in Latin, Greek and even Hebrew — and was praised by Erasmus on a visit to Oxford as a 'biblioteca trilinguis'. The important Spanish humanist Juan Luis Vives taught at Corpus while tutor to Mary Tudor, later Queen Mary I."<br>
<br>
"The humanistic ideas of the founder are still important to the college today, with a continued emphasis on the teaching of Latin, Ancient Greek, and ancient history. The college attempts to select the brightest students regardless of their social background. Corpus Christi has around 350 students (of which roughly 220 are undergraduates), which makes it one of the smallest colleges in Oxford."<br>

"Still situated in its original location, Exeter College was founded in 1314 by Walter de Stapeldon of Devon, Bishop of Exeter and later treasurer to Edward III, who intended it as a school to educate clergy. During its first century, it was known as Stapeldon Hall and was significantly smaller, with just twelve to fourteen students. The college grew significantly from the 15th century onward, and began offering rooms to its students. It was at this time that the Chapel was built.<br>
<br>
In the 16th century, donations from Sir William Petre, a former Exeter graduate, helped to expand and transform the college. As a result, Exeter College became one of the leading colleges in the University. The present Hall was built in the year 1618 with the rest of the college completed by 1710. In the 18th century the college experienced declining popularity, as did all of Oxford's other colleges. University reforms in the 1850s helped to end this period of stagnation.<br>
<br>
The college expanded again in the 20th century when it acquired new buildings, thereby enabling it to accommodate more undergraduate students. Until 1978 the college did not allow women students, but in 1993 Exeter College became the first of the former all-male colleges to elect a woman as its head."<br>

"It is centred around an architecturally appealing 18th century building: the Radcliffe Observatory, which is modelled after the ancient 'Tower of the Winds', Athens.<br><Br>

Established in 1979, the college is one of the youngest of the university, and is named after its main benefactors: Dr Cecil H. Green and his wife Dr Ida Green. Dr Green is a founder of Texas Instruments.

Green College is dedicated to human welfare in contemporary society. This is interpreted as an academic focus on medicine. Related disciplines, such as education, the environment and social sciences, however, are also covered.<br><Br>

30% of the students study in the field of medicine. About 20% are engaged in medical research on a post-graduate level. Environmental change and educational studies are two other strongholds of the college."<br>

						<description><![CDATA["Dominating the three-acre site of Green College is the eighteenth-century Radcliffe Observatory. The building functioned as an observatory for 160 years from 1773 until 1934, when the previous owners (the Radcliffe Trustees) decided to sell it and to erect a new observatory in Pretoria, South Africa, where the less polluted atmosphere would be suitable for the study of the southern hemisphere. <br>
<br>
The Observatory was built with funds from the trustees of Dr. John Radcliffe (1652-1714).  Building began in 1772 to plans by the architect Henry Keene, but only the Observer's House is his design. Upon Keene's death in 1776, the Observatory was completed to a different design by James Wyatt (1746-1813). Wyatt based his design on a small Tower of the Winds in Athens." <br>

"Originally run by Presbyterians, the college began life as Manchester Academy in 1786. The college was one of the few remaining dissenting academies that provided religious nonconformists with education. At the time, nonconformists were denied admission in Oxford and Cambridge. The Manchester Academy, however, made religion its key principle. The college changed location five times before settling in Oxford. It became an official college in 1996 and remains the university's newest college and the only one that exclusively accepts mature students."<br>

"The college was originally founded as Hart Hall in 1282 by Elias de Hertford. In medieval Oxford, halls were primarily lodging houses for students and resident tutors, and thus did not have the same status as full-fledged colleges. Many of the great minds of the English Renaissance studied at what would eventually become Hertford College, including the metaphysical poet John Donne, satirist Jonathan Swift, the political theorist Thomas Hobbes, and the first translator of the Bible into English, William Tyndale.<br>
<br>The Hall became Hertford College in 1740. Due to funding problems, the College's buildings were taken over as Magdalen Hall (not related to the similarly named Magdalen College whose separate Hall had been incorporated into the University as a college years before) in 1822. In 1874, the combined Hertford College/Magdalen Hall was finally re-established once again as a full college, largely due to the sponsorship of Sir Thomas Baring. <br>
<br>
Hertford was one of the first five co-educational colleges in the university. It has an almost equal gender balance with a slightly higher proportion of women to men. Traditionally seen as a progressive college, in the 1960s Hertford was one of the first colleges to encourage applicants from state schools, and has a significantly higher proportion of students from state schools relative to private schools."<br>

"Jesus College was founded in 1571, occupying in part the site of the earlier White Hall, which had existed for several hundred years from the 13th century up until 1570, just before Jesus began. Jesus was founded by eight commissioners, of whom Hugh Price is often credited as the main force, and received its Royal Charter from Elizabeth I.<br>
<br>
Originally intended for the tuition of clergymen, it broadened out academically as time went on, starting with the inclusion of medicine and law until now the college offers almost the full range of subjects taught at the university."<br>

Keble College's main buildings are on Parks Road, opposite the University Museum and the University Parks.<br>
<br>
"The best-known of Keble's Victorian founders was Edward Pusey, after whom parts of the College are named. The College itself is named after John Keble, one of Pusey's colleagues in the Oxford Movement, who died four years before its foundation in 1870. William Butterfield was appointed architect, and produced a masterpiece of Victorian Gothic. The College is built of red, blue, and white bricks; the main structure is of red brick, with white and blue patterned banding.<br>
<br>
On its construction, Keble was not widely admired within the University, particularly by the undergraduate population of nearby St John's College (from which Keble had purchased their land). A secret society was founded, entrance to which depended upon removing one brick from the College and presenting it to the society's elders. Some accounts specify that one of the commonest red bricks was necessary for ordinary membership, a rarer white brick for higher-level membership, and one of the rarest blue bricks for chairmanship. The hope was that eventually Keble would be completely demolished."<br>

"Kellogg College, Oxford's 36th college, is the base for part-time and other adult students in the University. The President and Fellows of Kellogg College are committed to supporting the lifelong learning work of the University and to the expansion of opportunities for adult, part-time and professional development students. The College was inaugurated in May 1990, matriculated its first students in 1992 and is working towards a programme of growth over the next decade. Its current student body numbers 350. The work of Kellogg College continues the tradition in which Oxford for over 100 years has played a pioneering role in providing opportunities for men and women wishing to study while still continuing with other aspects of their lives. The mission of Kellogg is to create more opportunities for lifelong learning, and to give more people access to Oxford and to higher education. 
<br><br>
The College [has recently moved] its facilities from its previous base in Wellington Square. The College's administrative offices are at 62 Banbury Road, whilst student accommodation is on Bradmore Road. Further development of the new site will enable all facilities (teaching, library, academic and dining) to be accommodated there during 2007."<br>

"Lady Margaret Hall, the first women's college in Oxford, was founded in 1879 by Elizabeth Wordsworth, a great-niece of the poet William Wordsworth. It was named for Lady Margaret Beaufort, a medieval noblewoman, mother of King Henry VII [and great-great-granddaughter of Edward III], known for her exceptional learning and high birth.  [Read about her<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Margaret_Beaufort"> HERE</a>]<br>


<br>The college's original house, Old Old Hall <b>[not a typo!</b>], is still in use. Its first nine students were (by rule) Anglicans, and Somerville College opened as a non-sectarian Oxford alternative a year later. In 1979, along with most of the other women's colleges, it decided to admit men as well as women."<br>

"<i>The College of the Blessed Mary and All Saints, Lincoln</i> is situated in the very centre of Oxford, lying on Turl Street next to Exeter and backing onto Brasenose.<br>
<br>
The College was founded in 1427 by Richard Fleming, then Bishop of Lincoln, (cadaver tomb in Lincoln Cathedral) to combat the Lollard teachings of John Wyclif. He intended it to be 'a little college of true students of theology who would defend the mysteries of Scripture against those ignorant laymen who profaned with swinish snouts its most holy pearls'.  Due to insufficient endowment, however, the College seems only to have survived thanks to the munificence of a second Bishop of Lincoln, Thomas Rotherham, who effectively re-founded it in the 1470s.<br>
<br>
In the 18th century Lincoln became the cradle of Methodism when John Wesley, at that time a fellow there, held religious meetings with his brother Charles.  Later it was the first college to admit a Jewish Fellow, the philosopher Samuel Alexander (appointed 1882). The College was the first in Oxford or Cambridge to provide a Middle Common Room exclusively for the use of graduate students. Lincoln has admitted women since the 1970s."<br>

"Magdalen College (pronounced ‘maudlin’) is one of the wealthiest of the Oxford colleges, with, in 2003, an estimated financial endowment of £116 million. It was founded as Magdalen Hall in 1448 by William of Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester. It became Magdalen College in 1458. The founder's statutes included provision for a choral foundation of men and boys and this tradition has continued to the present day.<br><br>

Widely regarded as one of the most beautiful of the Oxford and Cambridge colleges, Magdalen is also one of the most visited. It stands next to the River Cherwell and has within its grounds a deer park and Addison's Walk. The large, square Magdalen Tower is a famous Oxford landmark, and it is a tradition that the college choir sings from the top of it early on May Morning."<br>

"Located close to the University Parks, it is one of the smallest and less wealthy colleges within the university.  The college was originally founded (under the name of Spring Hill College) in Birmingham as a college for Nonconformist students who could not at that time be admitted to Oxford or Cambridge. The college moved to Oxford following the relaxation of the religious restrictions, and was founded in its present form in 1886. The Victorian buildings were designed by Basil Champneys.<br><br>

Until 1995 Mansfield was a Permanent Private Hall rather than a college, the Queen's Charter being awarded in that year. Undeniably with a population exceeding little more than 180 undergraduates at any one point, Mansfield remains the smallest undergraduate college in Oxford University apart from Harris Manchester, which only accepts mature students. Its reputation for food around the university is excellent. It is the leader of the University's F.E. Access scheme [encourages young people from inner city backgrounds, especially those from minority ethnic communities, to enter Higher Education in general and Oxford University in particular]  and has amongst the highest proportions of state school students at any Oxbridge college."<br>

"Merton College was founded in 1264 and is one of three ancient Oxford colleges founded in the thirteenth century. The College buildings, set in extensive gardens and grounds, are of exceptional historical and aesthetic interest. The Library is probably the oldest surviving working library in the United Kingdom, and the Hall, Chapel, Lodge and Mob Quadrangle also date from the College's early years.<br><br>
The College's founder was Walter de Merton, Lord Chancellor of England and Bishop of Rochester. Walter's conception of a self-governing community of scholars, with its own statutes and endowment, residing in buildings laid out in staircases and quadrangles, created a model and precedent for Oxford and Cambridge colleges founded in the succeeding centuries."<br>

"The official name of New College is the College of St Mary, and is the same as that of the older Oriel College; hence, it has been referred to as the 'New College of St Mary', or simply 'New College'.  <br><br>Despite its name, New College is one of the oldest of the Oxford colleges, having originally been founded in 1379. The second college in Oxford to be dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, it was founded by William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester. It was founded in conjunction with the famous Winchester College, which was envisaged as a feeder to the Oxford college, and the two institutions have striking architectural similarities. Both Winchester College and New College were originally established for the education of priests, there being a shortage of properly educated clergy after the Black Death.  As well as being the first Oxford college for undergraduates and the first to have Senior members of the college give tutorials, New College was the first college in Oxford to centre on a main quadrangle, with student rooms, a dining hall, a library, and study rooms within the square ring of buildings and gates. The quadrangle design inspired many of the later colleges"<br>

"<i>The Provost and Scholars of the House of the Blessed Mary the Virgin in Oxford, commonly called Oriel College, of the Foundation of Edward the Second of famous memory, sometime King of England</i> was the original name of Oriel College. The 'oriel' refers to the oriel windows of a former tenement building which stood on this site before the college was built.<br>
<br>
Oriel was founded in 1326 by Adam de Brome, a functionary at the court of Edward II. Brome induced the king to endow Oriel with money and lands, and Edward is therefore claimed as a co-founder by the college.<br>
<br>
Many of the original medieval buildings were rebuilt in the early 17th century, though they echo the Gothic style of the earlier buildings. The hall and chapel of the 14th century St. Mary's Hall survive, though the chapel is now the Junior Library and the hall is the Junior Common Room."<br>

"Founded in 1624, the College was named after the 3rd Earl of Pembroke, who was at the time Chancellor of the University and the patron of William Shakespeare. The official founder was King James I, and it is in his name that Pembroke students are permitted to wear silver tassels in their caps (mortarboards).<br><br>

The main buildings of the College date mainly from the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, and are built of Cotswold limestone. Pembroke also has modern accommodation built nearby on the banks of the River Thames at Grandpont, providing accommodation for almost a hundred undergraduates."<br>

"The Queen's College, founded 1341, is located on the High Street. It is one of the more wealthy colleges with an estimated financial endowment of £88m (2003).<br><br>
The college was founded during the 14th century by a chaplain, Robert de Eglesfield, of Queen Philippa of Hainault, wife of King Edward III of England, hence the name. The crest of three red eagles on a white background was inspired by the chaplain's surname. The magnificent frontage was designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor, part of a substantial rebuilding in the 18th century during which the impressive library was built."<br>

"What is now St Anne's College began as part of the 'Association for the Education of Women', the first institution in Oxford to allow for the education of women, then later the 'Society of Home Students'. In 1942 it became the 'St Anne's Society', and received a university charter to be founded as a women-only college in 1952.  It became coeducational in 1979.

"St Antony's is the most international of the seven graduate colleges of the University of Oxford, specialising in international relations, economics, politics, and history of particular parts of the world — Europe, Russia and the former Soviet states, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, China, South and South East Asia, and Latin America.<br><br>
St Antony's was founded in 1950 as the result of the gift of Antonin Besse of Aden, a merchant of French descent. Its role was 'to be a centre of advanced study and research in the fields of modern international history, philosophy, economics and politics and to provide an international centre within the University where graduate students from all over the world can live and work together in close contact with senior members of the University who are specialists in their fields'.<br><br>
The College opened its doors to its first students in Michaelmas term 1950 and received its Royal Charter in 1953. A Supplementary Charter in 1962 was granted to allow the College to admit women as well as men, and in 1963 the College was made a full member of the University."<br>

"St Catherine's College was founded in 1962 by the distinguished historian Alan Bullock, who went on to become the first Master of the college, and later Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University. The college is descended from the St Catherine's Society, an association of Oxford undergraduates who were otherwise unattached to a college. Originally open only to male students, St Catherine's admitted women from 1974, becoming one of the first five co-educational colleges in the university."<br>

The establishment of the college, together with that of Iffley (now Wolfson) College, arose out of pressure on the University, during the early 1960s, to solve the related problems of senior members of the University (teaching, library, museum and administrative staff), who were entitled under statute to hold a college fellowship, but who had not been elected, and of the increasing numbers of graduate students, who needed a college affiliation.<br><br>
The college was formally founded in 1965, close to the parish church of St Cross, and accepted its first graduate students in the following year." <br>

"Within the University it is better known by its nickname, 'Teddy Hal'. It has a claim to being 'the oldest academical society for the education of undergraduates (A. B. Emden) in any University'.<br><br>

Like the University of Oxford itself, the precise date of establishment of St Edmund Hall is unknown; it is usually estimated at 1225. The college is named after St Edmund of Abingdon, Oxfordshire, the first known Oxford Master of Arts and the first Oxford-educated Archbishop of Canterbury, who lived and taught on the college site.

St Edmund Hall began life as one of Oxford's ancient Aularian houses, the mediaeval halls that laid the foundation of the University, preceding the creation of the first colleges. As the only surviving mediaeval hall, its members are known as 'Aularians'. St Edmund Hall took on the status of a college in 1957, though retaining the historical moniker of 'Hall'."

"St. Hilda's was founded as an Oxford hall for women in 1893 by Dorothea Beale, Principal of the Cheltenham Ladies' College. It is the only remaining college to admit only female students. However, proposals have been made that the college should accept male students from Michaelmas Term of 2009. This would require a two-thirds majority vote of the Governing Body, which has not been achieved in other votes on this proposal, most notably one held in 2003."<br>

"Compared to many Oxford Colleges, St Hugh's is young. It was founded in 1886 by Elizabeth Wordsworth, the great niece of the poet. But she had a strong sense of the historical perspective in which her new foundation would take its place. Using money left to her by her father, a bishop of Lincoln, she named it after one of his twelfth century predecessors, Hugh of Avalon, who was canonised in 1220, and in whose diocese Oxford had been. Elizabeth Wordsworth was a champion of the cause of womens education, and her foundation was intended to enable poorer women to gain an Oxford education."<br>

"St. John's College was founded by Sir Thomas White, a merchant, in 1555, and his heart is buried in the chapel. It is the most wealthy college at Oxford with an estimated financial endowment of £220m (2003).  <br><br>
Thomas White was a Catholic, and St John's was originally intended to provide a source of educated Catholic clerics to support the Counter-Reformation under Queen Mary.  White was Master of the Merchant Taylors' Company, and established a number of educational foundations including the Merchant Taylors' schools. Although the College was closely linked to those institutions for many centuries, it became a more open society in the later 19th century. The endowments which St John's was given at its foundation, and during the 20 or so years afterward, served it very well. In the second half of the nineteenth century it benefited, as ground landlord, from the suburban development of the city of Oxford and was unusual among Colleges for the size and extent of its property within the city.<br><br>

Although primarily a producer of Anglican clergymen in the earlier periods of its history, St John's also gained a reputation for both law and medicine. <br>

The site was formerly the Cistercian monastery of St Bernard. Fairly large, it comprises approximately 400 undergraduates and 250 postgraduates and academic staff."<br><br>
Notable fellows and alumni have included Jane Austen's father and brothers and Tony Blair.<br>

"St. Peter's College occupies the site of two of the University's oldest Inns or medieval hostels, Bishop Trellick's, later New Inn Hall, and Rose Hall, both of which were founded in the thirteenth century. But its history really began in 1929 when St. Peter's Hall was founded by Francis James Chavasse, Bishop of Liverpool, who was concerned at the rising cost of education in the older universities in Britain, and projected St. Peter's as a College where promising students, who might otherwise be deterred by the costs of College life elsewhere, could obtain an Oxford education. The commitment to make Oxford accessible to any student of ability, irrespective of means, remains a feature of St. Peter's today. <br><br>
In 1961 the University approved a statute giving St. Peter's Hall full collegiate status. With the granting of its Royal Charter in the same year, it took the name St. Peter's College."

"Somerville is a college for women and men. It was founded (as Somerville Hall) in 1879 to provide an opportunity for women, who at that date were excluded from membership of the University, to gain some kind of higher education in Oxford. The founders' insistence that students should be subjected to no religious tests or obligations marked Somerville off from its Anglican counterpart, Lady Margaret Hall, and set the tone of cultural diversity which has characterised the college to this day.<br><br>
Membership of the University did not bring instant acceptance. Women remained debarred from many university clubs and societies (including the Union) for many years to come; their colleges were not recognised as full colleges of the university until 1959; and it was only in the 1970s (when the men's colleges began to go mixed) that they were allowed to play a full part in university administration. In the many intervening battles for equality, Somerville played a leading role: in 1936 it was the first Oxford college to grant maternity leave, and in 1950 the first to seek self-government. Meanwhile, in the wider world, its alumnae were breaking new ground in opening up careers for women in such fields as politics, the civil service, broadcasting, journalism, commerce, and law."<br>

The college was founded in 1965 as the Oxford Centre for Management Studies. It was renamed Templeton College in 1983 as a result of a donation from Sir John Templeton, in honour of his parents, Harvey Maxwell and Vella Handly Templeton. Initially a 'society of entitlement' in the University, Templeton College began admitting graduate students in 1984 and became a full graduate college of the University by Royal Charter in 1995.

"University College is (arguably!) the oldest college at Oxford University, founded in 1249. Here is a description of the college by Thomas Neale (1519-1590?), Professor of Hebrew at Oxford, for the visit of Queen Elizabeth I on 31st August 1566: <br><br>
'Now before your eyes a handsome college appears which although it is a section, has acquired the name of the entire establishment. Just as in logic a section is often named after a group and a single division frequently stands for the entire body. Archdeacon William of Durham gave this college a name taken from a city which was synonymous with learning.'<br><br>
Founded in the reign of King Alfred in 873. Restored by William Archdeacon of Durham in about 1249 A.D.  The claim that King Alfred founded the College is now considered apocryphal, but makes a good tale anyway.'"<br>

"Wadham College was founded by Nicholas and Dorothy Wadham, wealthy Somerset landowners, during the reign of King James I.
<br><br>
Although it is one of the youngest of the historic colleges, Wadham has some of the oldest and best preserved buildings, a result of the rash of rebuilding that occurred throughout Oxford during the 17th century.  A dramatic expansion since 1952 has made use of a range of 17th and 18th century houses, a converted warehouse originally built to store bibles.  It also includes the Holywell Music Room, the oldest such building in Europe. Wadham also has a second claim to fame: it is thought that the college's chapel was the first religious building in England to regain its stained glass and statuary following the reformation.<br><br>

Under the original statutes, women were forbidden from entering the college, with the exception of a laundress who was to be of 'such age, condition, and reputation as to be above suspicion.' These rules were relaxed over the years, and in 1974 they were altered to allow for the admission of women as full members of college at all levels. In fact, Wadham was the first historically all-male college to have a female student."<br>

"Wolfson College is unusual in being a graduate-only college, and is one of the most modern in the university, in architectural terms.  The college began its existence in 1965, under the name of Iffley College. It was founded with the aim to expand the opportunities of graduate studies at the University of Oxford. With the aid of a grant from the Wolfson Foundation and the Ford Foundation, the college gradually expanded, achieving full collegiate status in 1981.<br><br>
It is one of the larger colleges of the university. Wolfson College is quietly located in the north of Oxford along the River Cherwell. There are over sixty governing body fellows, about thirty research fellows in the college and another forty junior research fellows. The college caters to a wide range of subjects, both in natural and social sciences. It is one of the most egalitarian colleges in Oxford - for instance, there is only one Common Room organization for all the members of the college, students and Fellows alike."<br>

"There has been an institution of learning on the College site since the late thirteenth-century, though Worcester College, in its current form, was founded only in 1714.  <br><br>

The buildings, particularly in the main quad, are diverse. On the north side there is an imposing eighteenth-century neo-classical building, and on the south side the 'Pump Quad' and the picturesque row of medieval 'cottages' which are among the oldest residential buildings in Oxford, and are the surviving parts of Gloucester College, Worcester's predecessor, which was founded in 1283 for the Benedictine order.  <br><br>

The Dissolution of the Monasteries in about 1539 ended the existence of Gloucester College. After a brief interlude, Gloucester Hall, which lacked the full range of powers of an independent College, occupied the earlier buildings but in 1714 it was refounded as Worcester College after a Worcestershire baronet, Sir Thomas Cookes, had left a benefaction for the foundation of a new college."<br>

					<visibility>0</visibility>
					<description><![CDATA["Greyfriars is both a Franciscan Friary and a University Permanent Private Hall: a Franciscan Friary, because the Capuchin friars of the Order of the Friars Minor, whose home it is, follow the Rule of St Francis of Assisi. <br><br>The Franciscans first came to Oxford in 1224, less than forty years after its recognition as a University. They were received by Henry III, who gave them part of an island called Paradise Garden. Here they built their Church and Friary - the original Greyfriars, whose first Head, Robert Grosseteste, became Chancellor of the university. On the dissolution of the Friary in the sixteenth century, the Franciscan presence in Oxford was suppressed until it was restored by the Capuchin branch of the Franciscan Order. Their Friary, St Anselm's in St John Street, was granted the status of a House of Studies by the University in 1910. In 1919, the friars moved to the Iffley Road to premises which they called Grosseteste House. In 1930, on completion of the present distinctive flint building, the name of Greyfriars was once more adopted by the friars.<br><br>

The University conferred the status of a Permanent Private Hall on Greyfriars on the 18th of June 1957. Like other Colleges and Halls of the University, greyfriars selects its own students, presents them for matriculation in the University, is responsible for their academic studies, and, eventually, presents them for their degrees."<br>

The London Baptist Education Society was founded in 1752. In 1810, the Society became a collegiate institution and in 1856 it moved to Regent's Park in London, whence the name derives. As early as 1841 Regent's Park College was affiliated to the University of London and its students were able to read for university degrees in the Arts and Law, as well as training for Christian ministry. In 1901 the college became an official Divinity School of the University of London. In 1927 it moved to Oxford and in 1957 became a Permanent Private Hall of the University.

				<description><![CDATA["The Taylor institution was built as the main modern languages department for Oxford University, and is joined to the Ashmolean. <br><br>

It was built at the core of the city in 1884, replacing an old building used before as lodgings for students. It was founded by the architect Sir Robert Taylor, who left money to build a modern languages department in Oxford. The will was contested by Taylor’s son, but eventually the building was designed, in a Neo classical style. <br><br>The building itself fluently combines the beauty of old architecture with the convenience of modern technology. With over 500,000 books, many of them antique, its library is the largest of its kind in Britain."<br>
<a href=http://www.oxfordhistory.co.uk/taylor.html>INFORMATION SOURCE</a><br><br>

"Known as 'The Taylorian' and completed in 1844, this building, with its impressive classical features inside and out, houses lecture theatres, offices and the main libraries and reading rooms of the Modern Languages Faculty, and is used mainly by students of the university. The female statues on top of the four Ionic columns represent France, Italy, Germany and Spain, whose languages are the main ones taught in the building.<br><br>

Please note that this building is not open to the public."<br>

In recent years the Department has grown very considerably, and now every year more than 15,000 people join one or more of our courses. Our students may be members of the public who wish to study a subject out of general interest or for personal satisfaction, members of professional groups or business organisations who wish to update their professional knowledge and skills, or participants in our increasingly large number of courses for international groups.<br><br>

Most of our longer courses now lead to a University award or other forms of credit, but the large number of short courses offered every year may be taken by those who are less interested in obtaining further qualifications. Courses last from one day to several weeks; the residential courses are held in Oxford, but other part-time courses are also held in a large number of other centres."<br>

It is the centre of learning for graduate and undergraduate students in business, economics and finance from the University of Oxford. Its flagship programmes are its one-year MBA programme, the 21-month executive MBA and the new one-year MFE (Masters in Financial Economics) programme.  It also offers, jointly with the Department of Economics, a top-ranked undergraduate programme in Economics and Management.<br>
<br>
The MBA programme was ranked as the top one-year programme in the UK and the best school in 'value-for money' terms worldwide by the Financial Times in 2005. It currently accepts 220 students each October.<br>
<br>
The Saïd Business School was formed in 1996 out of the University of Oxford School of Management Studies. The new business school building was completed in 2001 with a £23 million benefaction from Syrian-British businessman Wafic Saïd.  Its opening on November 5, 2001 was accompanied by protests by anticapitalist students mainly because of the controversial nature of Wafic Saïd's donation (whose wealth is partly derived from advising on multiple armament contracts between the UK and Saudi-Arabia)."<br>
<br>
In 2005, SBS acquired the executive education business of Templeton College, the University's business-focused postgraduate college."<br>

				<name>Indian Institute (Faculty of History Building)</name>
				<visibility>0</visibility>
				<description><![CDATA[The Indian Institute is the home of the History Faculty of the University of Oxford.  It was designed by Basil Champneys and built 1882–3.<br><br>
"The aim of the Indian Institute was 'the work of fostering and facilitating Indian studies in the University; the work of making Englishmen, and even Indians themselves, appreciate better than they have done before the languages, literature and industries of India'. As well as a library and lecture rooms, it contained a museum, some of whose contents are now in the Ashmolean. 
<br><br>
Since the Indian Institute had been paid for by funds collected privately in India and Britain, there was some controversy in 1968 when its library was moved to a specially constructed penthouse on top of the New Bodleian so that the original building could be taken over by the central University Offices. When these in turn moved to Wellington Square, Oxford's Modern History Faculty moved from its premises in Merton Street (now occupied by the Philosophy Centre)."

					<description>&quot;The Bodleian Library is not one library, but many.  It is housed in buildings spread all over the city of Oxford.&quot;</description>

						<name>Bodleian Library (old)</name>
						<visibility>0</visibility>
						<description><![CDATA["The historic core of the Bodleian is located around Radcliffe Square with the oldest parts being the magnificent Duke Humphrey's Library (1488), and the Divinity School. The New Buildings are just beyond on the corner of Broad Street and Parks Road. The Old and New Buildings are linked by an underground passage to allow books to be easily transferred between the buildings.<br>
<br>
The Bodleian buildings began in 1613, at the bequest of former Oxford student Thomas Bodley. It is now the second largest library in the UK (after the British Library in London). The Bodleian Library is the main research library of the University of Oxford. It is also a copyright deposit library and its collections are used by scholars from around the world. As a copyright library, it receives a copy of every new book printed in Britain, a practice that began in 1610, so that the library contains an unrivaled 400 year record of British literature.<br>
<br>
The Bodleian is unique in that it is not a lending library - no books can be borrowed, only read on the premises. The Bodleian takes this restriction seriously; in a famous case, King Charles I was refused permission to borrow a book.<br>
<br>
The general public cannot enter the reading rooms; that right is reserved for members. Other parts of the library can be seen on one of the frequent guided tours. One of the highlights of these tours is the Divinity School, which possesses a remarkable vaulted ceiling. It is rightly regarded as a masterpiece of English Gothic architecture."<br>

<br>
"The Clarendon Building in Oxford, England, stands in the centre of the city in Broad Street, near the Bodleian Library and the Sheldonian Theatre. For many years it was the home of the Oxford University Press; today it is part of the Bodleian.<br><br>

The building was designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor (Christopher Wren's greatest pupil) and built (1711–1715) to house the Press's printing operations. (Before its construction the presses were in the basement of the Sheldonian Theatre, and the compositors could not work when the Theatre was in use for ceremonies.)<br><br>

The building was financed largely from the proceeds of the commercially successful History of the Great Rebellion by Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, whose money also paid for the building of the Clarendon Laboratory in Oxford.." <br>

					<description><![CDATA["The Codrington Library is a private library, and admission is by application only. Undergraduates of Oxford University, bona fide researchers, and others at the discretion of the Librarian are admitted only on receipt and approval of the appropriate application form.<br><br>

The Library is a reference library only. Most of the Law books and journals are on open shelves; the other collections are closed access, and must be requested (these books are usually delivered to readers within a few minutes).<br><br>

Readers wishing to use material from the Early and Special Collections are advised that written application must be made at least a week in advance. As there is limited space available, it is helpful if researchers can give several dates on which they could come to the library.<br><br>


The main catalogue of the library is the card catalogue in the Codrington. Approximately 30,000 volumes are catalogued onto OLIS, but only the card catalogue represents the entire collection. All new acquisitions are added to the card catalogue, as well as catalogued onto OLIS. Work is in progress to catalogue the rest of the collection – but it should be noted that this will not be complete for several years<br>

					<description><![CDATA["Perhaps Lincoln's most striking feature, the Library is an 18th century converted church.  It provides access to most of the main texts required by undergraduates, while also providing for more specialised needs in the form of journals and papers.  It serves as a beautiful and peaceful backdrop for hard work.<br><br>

The original Library was housed on the first floor of the north range of Front Quad, in the current SCR.  Books in the original Library were expensive and so were secured by metal chains to the desk or lectern that housed them.  The books were chained even as late as 1739 - Lincoln may have been the last Oxford colleges to discontinue the practice.  Originally, the Library could only be used by Fellows - in 1813 was it agreed that undergraduates could use the Library, but only if accompanied by a Fellow.<br><br>

The College Library has, since the 1970s, been housed in All Saints Church, which was part of the original foundation of the College."

					<description><![CDATA["Modern Art Oxford is an art gallery established in 1969 at the University of Oxford. From 1969 to 2002 the gallery was known as The Museum of Modern Art, Oxford. The gallery's original founders—a small group of Oxford dons— aspired to build it into a museum with a permanent collection by way of an endowment from the University; Oxford declined, leaving the gallery with a misnomer. With funding from the Arts Council of Great Britain, the gallery survived as a venue for temporary exhibitions. Andrew Nairne renamed the gallery to its current monicker in 2002."<br>
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art,_Oxford>INFORMATION SOURCE</a><br><br>
"Now housed in a converted warehouse, this museum specialises in 20th-century art. Permanent displays of paintings and drawings are complemented by regular temporary exhibitions of modern sculpture, photography, paintings, printing, ceramics and textiles. Don't be put off by the building's characterless exterior. In fact once inside, you'll probably find that the stark white walls are the perfect setting for the exhibits. MOMA also has a comprehensive programme of lectures, concerts and films."<br>

It was founded in 1884 when General Pitt Rivers, an influential figure in the development of archaeology and evolutionary anthropology, gave his collection to the University. The General's founding gift contained more than 18,000 objects but there are now over half a million. Many were donated by early anthropologists and explorers. The collection includes extensive photographic and sound archives which contain early records of great importance.

					<description><![CDATA["The Cardiac Science Centre is a four-storey extension integrated into the University Laboratory of Physiology, and houses a state-of-the art infrastructure in basic science concerned with myocardial biology.<br><br>

Sir John S Burdon Sanderson (1828–1905) was the pioneer of cardiac electrophysiology and the first Waynflete Professor of Physiology, then Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford.<br><br>

The particular focus of the centre is understanding how the heart behaves during stress (deprived oxygen). Three major technical platforms support the research groups: imaging (from single cell to whole heart; involving structural, electrical and metabolic visualisation); computational modelling of cardiac function based on experimental data (the Heart Physiome Project); and gene delivery systems, including stem cell technology, to provide a framework for investigating cardiac signalling systems, and for rescuing impaired myocardial phenotypes."<br>
