Contains various unit tests to test the functionality of the Gaboto system.
</p>
<p>
Although the tests are far from being exhaustive they will give you a good indication of whether
you introduced bugs by extending the system. If one of these tests (run {@link org.oucs.gaboto.test.classes.TestAllRealModel}
to run all unit tests) fails you should either have a very good explanation or you should go back
to your code and search for bugs.
</p>
<p>
Since many tests add or remove data they should not be run to test a live system.
